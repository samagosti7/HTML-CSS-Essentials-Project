#Milestone Project 1--HTML-CSS essentials project

The ability to create a website is a key skill for web developers. This project is the first of what will hopefully be many sites built in my coding career.  

##Motivation
I love riddles myself, and wanted to create a page that would serve as an online bank of riddles ready to be used whenever the user needed.  While 5 riddles isn't exactly a bank, it is a reasonable start and sufficient within the scope of the project.  Going forward, I would look to increase the riddle count, and possibly add a way to create a group of user-favorited riddles, to appear in a specific section or page of the site.  This mini-bank of favorited riddles is the initial vision I'd had for the site, and was my motivation for creating it.  

##Directions
Any initial link should take you directly to the landing page, titled home.  This features a hero image, and a small about us section.  At the top, as will be present on all site pages, there is a nav element that can take you to the two other pages.  

Page 2, titled Riddles, is the main content page, featuring 5 riddles and their solutions.  The solutions were given a pesudo class of hover, such that in order to see the solution the user must hover over the relevant area.  The hoverable area isn't the entire width of the page, instead it stays closer to the center of the page where the answer will appear--this is to lessen the chances of a user prematurely revealing an answer accidentally.  

The final link will lead you to page 3, the form page where a user would theoretically be able to submit their own riddles to the site. At the moment, of course this won't happen, as the form is being sent only to this URL: https://formdump.codeinstitute.net, the default form practice URL provided to us. However one can test the inputs on this page as if they were submitting their own riddle for consideration.

##Bugs
At the very bottom of the page, there are two small margin-like areas of green surrounding the social media footer. The area at the top of the footer is intentional, however the area at the bottom is not, and I consider it a bug. I entered 0 margin and padding for the overarching html and body elements, and inspecting the area on dev-tools yielded no hints to where it comes from.
